# Polygon-Based Road Map Generator using Canvas

This project allows you to create custom road maps using polygons within an HTML5 canvas. The concept and inspiration for this project are derived from lessons by [Radu Mariescu-Istodor available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_C7L7zelz8&list=PLB0Tybl0UNfZtY5IQl1aNwcoOPJNtnPEO&ab_channel=RaduMariescu-Istodor).

## Overview

The primary aim of this project is to enable users to design and generate various road maps by drawing polygons on an HTML5 canvas. Users can create different maps by defining polygons that represent roads, intersections, or other features.

## Features

- **Canvas-Based Map Creation**: Utilizes HTML5 canvas to draw and visualize road maps.
- **Polygon Drawing**: Allows users to draw and define polygons to create road structures.
- **Map Generation**: Generates road maps based on the polygons created within the canvas.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ggenzone/virtual-world.git
    ```

2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser supporting HTML5 canvas.

## Usage

- Use the drawing tools provided to create polygons that represent roads, intersections, or other elements of the map.
- Experiment with different polygon shapes and arrangements to generate diverse road maps.
